Archive disabler allows you to "turn off" some of WordPress' built in archive pages.

== Description ==

Archive Disabler allows you to disable WordPress' default archive pages.  It does this by either redirecting those archive pages or causing them to throw a 404 error depending on your settings.

You may want to do this if, for instance, you didn't want to expose post format archives to the world.  Instead you could redirect them to the home page of your site.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file
2. Unzip it 
3. Upload the archive disabler folder to your `wp-content/plugins` directory
4. Activate!

Alternatively, you can install the plugin via the built in WordPress installer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the redirect location? =

Absolutely, but there is no GUI for it.  There is the filter `cd_ad_redirect` for you to hook into and customize away.  This filter fires after `template_redirect`, so you can use can of the [Conditional Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags).
